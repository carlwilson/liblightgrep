Why another regexp engine?\r\n\r\nLightgrep:\r\n * searches for many patterns simultaneously\r\n * searches binary data as a stream, not as discrete lines of text\r\n * searches for patterns in many different encodings; give it dirty data, lightgrep don't care\r\n * never, ever, ever, never, never looks at a byte twice or backs up in your input\r\n * implements a large number of standard regexp features\r\n * follows the same hit-reporting rules as [PCRE](http://www.pcre.org/)\r\n * degrades gracefully in performance as patterns increase in number and complexity\r\n\r\nLightgrep is still pretty new and doesn't have all the regexp features you might be used to. But it has enough features to be more than a toy, and what is supported is well-tested.\r\n\r\nliblightgrep is copyright (c) 2010-2015, [Stroz Friedberg, LLC](http://www.strozfriedberg.com). liblightgrep is available under version 3 of the GNU Public License. See [COPYING](COPYING) for details.\r\n\r\n## Technical Info\r\n--------------\r\nLightgrep is implemented in portable C++11 but exposes a concise C API. The core of the API is defined in [include/lightgrep/api.h](./include/lightgrep/api.h). You can see a small example program at [c_example/main.c](./c_example/main.c).\r\n\r\nLightgrep depends on a number of [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) libraries and also on [ICU](http://www.icu-project.org). Currently you will need gcc 4.6+ or clang 3.1 to compile the libraries.\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n-------\r\nSee the [BUILD.md file](BUILD.md) for installation instructions.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### C API\r\n\r\n### Python API\r\n\r\n## Syntax\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
